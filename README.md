This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Golf Ball Assistant Chat Application

## Description
This project is a web application where users can interact with an AI-powered assistant specializing in recommending golf balls based on the user's preferences and needs.

The assistant can also display golf ball offers through integration with the Amazon Product Advertising API and manage multiple requests while handling rate limits.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: React framework for fast web applications with both static and server-side rendering.
- **OpenAI API**: Used to create the virtual assistant that responds to user queries.
- **Flask**: Python web framework used for the backend API that handles Amazon product searches.
- **AWS Product Advertising API**: Used to search and display golf ball products on Amazon.
- **TypeScript**: Used for the frontend (Next.js) and backend logic (OpenAI API route).
- **Python**: Used for the backend API that handles AWS authentication and search logic.

## Requirements
- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **Python 3.x**
- An **OpenAI** account with an API key.
- An **AWS** account with credentials for the **Product Advertising API**.

## Installation

### Backend
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/golfballassistant.git
   cd golfballassistant
2. **Set up the backend (Flask)**:
   - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r app/api/requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `app/api/` directory with the following content:
     ```
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key>
     AWS_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
     OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
     ```

4. **Run the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app/api/app.py
   
## Frontend

1. **Install dependencies**:
   - Ensure you're in the root directory of your project and install the necessary packages:
     ```bash
     npm install next react react-dom axios openai
     npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
     npm install dotenv
     ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   - In the root directory, create a `.env.local` file for Next.js environment variables:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
     ```

3. **Run the Next.js development server**:
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the frontend.
  
Usage

    Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
    Enter your name and email in the entry form.
    Interact with the AI assistant. You can ask questions about your golf preferences, and the assistant will recommend golf balls based on your responses.
    The assistant will also display golf ball offers from Amazon.

##Communication Schema and Workflow
#Communication between Frontend and Backend

    Frontend (Next.js):
        The user interacts with the chat page. The questions are sent to the OpenAI API via the /api/chat/route.ts route.
        The assistant responds based on the userâ€™s messages using the GPT-4 model provided by OpenAI.
    Backend (Flask):
        Golf ball search requests sent from the assistant are managed by Flask.
        Flask handles requests via the /search route, which sends requests to the Amazon Product Advertising API.
        The response includes details such as product titles, images, and prices, which are then displayed to the user.

#Workflow

    User Interaction: The user starts a conversation, and the OpenAI assistant generates responses or recommendations.
    Amazon Product Search: If the assistant identifies golf ball models in the message, it triggers a search via the Amazon API and returns the results with links to Amazon.
    API Rate Management: The Flask server includes logic to handle API rate limits, ensuring requests to the Amazon API are throttled to avoid overloading.
